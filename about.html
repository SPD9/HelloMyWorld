		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p> Bubble under is a group of diving enthusiastics based in <br/>
			the south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the summer<br/>
			months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are flowing.<br/>
			<em><strong>We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the costs of<br/>
			accommodation and travel and to ensure that everyone gets a <br/>
			trustworthy dive buddy</strong><em></p>
			
		<r> Although we are based in the south-west, we don't stay on our<br/>
			own turf. <br/>past diving weekends away have included trips up to<br/> 
			<em>Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerous wreck sites</em></br></r>
			
		<v> when we are not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to talk<br/>
			about our recent adventures </v>
